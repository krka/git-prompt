# Valgrind suppressions for git-prompt
#
# This file suppresses known issues from the git submodule libraries
# that we don't control. Add suppressions here for:
# - Known issues in libgit.a
# - Platform-specific libc issues
# - Other third-party library issues

# Example suppression (currently empty - add as needed)
# {
#    git_config_leak
#    Memcheck:Leak
#    ...
#    fun:git_config_*
# }
